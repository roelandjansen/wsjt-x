Download and execute the package file {win32}, following these
instructions:

* Install _WSJT-X_ into its own directory, for example `C:\WSJTX` or `
  C:\WSJT\WSJTX`, rather than the conventional location `C:\Program
  Files (x86)\WSJTX`.

* All program files relating to _WSJT-X_ will be stored in the chosen
  installation directory and its subdirectories.

* Logs and other writeable files will normally be found in the
  directory +

`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\WSJT-X`.

TIP: Your computer may be configured so that this directory is
     "`invisible`".  It's there, however, and accessible.  An
     alternative (shortcut) directory name is
     `"%LocalAppData%\WSJT-X\"`.

* The built-in Windows facility for time synchronization is usually
  not adequate. We recommend the program _Meinberg NTP_ (see
  {ntpsetup} for downloading and installation instructions) or
  _Dimension 4_ from {dimension4}. Recent versions of Windows 10 are
  now shipped with a more capable Internet time synchronization
  service that is suitable if configured appropriately.

  From this version onward _WSJT-X_ requires the _OpenSSL_ libraries
  to be installed. Suitable libraries may already be installed on your
  system, if they are not you will see this error shortly after
  startup. To fix this you need to install the _OpenSSL_ libraries.

** You can download a suitable _OpenSSL_ package for from
   {win_openssl_packages}, you need the latest *Win32 v1.0.2 Lite*
   version (Note it is the Win32 package even if you are using a
   64-bit Windows operating system) which at the time of writing was
   {win32_openssl}.

** Install the package and accept the default options, including the
   option to copy the _OpenSSL_ DLLs to the Windows system directory
   (this is important). +

NOTE: If you still get the same network error after installing the
      _OpenSSL_ libraries then you also need to install the
      {msvcpp_redist} component. From the download page select
      `vcredist_x86.exe` and run it to install.

TIP: If you cannot install the _OpenSSL_ libraries or do not have an
     Internet connection on the computer used to run
     _WSJT-X_&nbsp;{VERSION_MAJOR}.{VERSION_MINOR}, you can download
     the _LoTW_ file manually. Go to
     https://lotw.arrl.org/lotw-user-activity.csv in a web browser,
     download the file, then move it to the _WSJT-X_ log files
     directory. This directory can be opened by selecting
     *File&nbsp;|&nbsp;Open&nbsp;log&nbsp;directory*.

* _WSJT-X_ expects your sound card to do its raw sampling at 48000 Hz.
  To ensure that this will be so when running under recent versions of
  Windows, open the system's *Sound* control panel and select in turn
  the *Recording* and *Playback* tabs. Click on *Properties*, then
  *Advanced*, and select *16 bit, 48000 Hz (DVD Quality)*. Switch of
  all audio enhancement features for these devices.

* You can uninstall _WSJT-X_ by clicking its *Uninstall* link in the
  Windows *Start* menu, or by using *Uninstall a Program* on the
  Windows Control Panel Programs and Features option or in Settings
  Apps on Windows 10.
