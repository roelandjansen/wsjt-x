Debian, Ubuntu, and other Debian-based systems including Raspbian:

NOTE: The project team release binary installer packages for Linux
when a new _WSJT-X_ release is announced, note that these are built to
target one contemporary version of a Linux distribution. Although
these may work on newer Linux versions or even different
distributions, it is unlikely that they will work on older
versions. Check the notes provided with the release for details of the
targeted Linux distributions and versions. If the binary package is
not compatible with your Linux distribution or version you must build
the application from sources.
